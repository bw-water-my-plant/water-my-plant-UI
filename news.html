                                    <h3>Succulents are NOT cactuses (usually)</h3>
                                    <p>Strange, but true. A succulent is a plant that stores water for a long time in its leaves. This is why the leaves are so plump! Many succulent varieties hail from dry climates, so they need to store the water to survive.</p>
                                    <p>Succulents aren't all cactuses, but cactuses are all succulents. Feeling like squares and rectangles yet? Cactuses are just one type of succulent. The big difference between them is the obvious one: cactuses have thorns or spines!</p>

                                    <h3>Succulents are ANCIENT</h3>
                                    <p>Succulents evolved millions of years ago, and have lasted as a life form ever since! It's not hard to see why -- succulents are built to survive harsh, low-water conditions. Not all prehistoric life forms are so cute! Looking at you, crocodiles.</p>

                                    <h3>Succulents are EASY PEASY</h3>
                                    <p>It's not hard to keep a succulent alive, unless you're the author of this article. The author's succulents are probably surviving despite her care, not because of her care. But BACK TO BUSINESS!</p>
                                    <p>Succulents require very little watering and almost no fertilizing. In fact, if you over-water or over-fertilize your succulent, it can start to rot due to the water or wilt because the roots have been burned away. Aske me how I know! No, I'm not bitter.</p>

                                    <h3>Succulents can make MORE SUCCULENTS</h3>
                                    <p>If you have a succulent obsession the way some of do, it's easy to want more and more! But the pocketbook doesn't always agree with a succulent habit, so we must turn to succulents themselves for the solution.</p>
                                    <p>Thankfully, succulents provide! Just take the leaf of a succulent (eith cut off of fallen off), stick it in sunlight until it grows little rootlets, then put it in some soil and give it an occasional drip of water. BAM! New succulent.</p>

                                                    Farmers are no strangers to the lawsuits from Monstanto. Since the mid‑1990s, Monsanto has filed suit against 145 individual U.S. farmers for patent infringement and/or breach of contract in connection with its genetically engineered seed. It has proceeded through trial against only eleven farmers, but won every case. The Center for Food Safety has listed 90 lawsuits by Monsanto against farmers for claims of seed patent violations.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Monsanto defends its patents and their use, explaining that patents are necessary to ensure that it is paid for its products and for all the investments it puts into developing products.
                                                </p>

                                                    But such claims don't satisfy Bartleby Harrison, bean farmer and organizer of Farmers Against Monsanto. "Monsanto has taken people to court because bees pollinated crops one field over. They're not interested in working with people to fix problems -- this is just a corporation flexing its muscles to crowd out honest farmers."

                                                   Monsanto declined to comment on any specific allegations, and released a statement: "The principle behind a farmer’s seed contract is simple: a business must be paid for its product."</p>

Twice now I have returned from a nice morning stroll in the park to find my begonias cruelly uprooted. I have not seen the culprits responsible for this heinous crime, but I just know it's due to the gaggle of kids from the school across the river. They haven't liked me since I informed their teacher they were secretly keeping a stray dog . I'm sorry, but that clearly against regul </p>

                                        <p>We've all been there: you buy a beautiful plant, excited about the addition to your garden. Maybe you're taking the plunge and this is your first plant! The first tomatoes you'll grow, the first potatoes you'll harvest, the first echeveria you're taking care of...but then, the worst happens. Your plant wilts! Maybe you gave it too much water? Maybe not enough? WHO CAN KNOW?</p>
                                        <p>You're not alone, reader. The good news is that it doesn't have to be that hard. Read on for handy watering tips.</p>
                                        <p>The best time to water plants is usually in the morning. Why? Mornings tend to be cool with less winds, so the amount of water lost to evaporation is reduced. If you water in the evening, plants stay damp overnight, making them more likely to be damaged by fungal and bacterial diseases.</p>
                                        <p>Ideally, you want to water the roots, not the greenery, which is easily damaged. A drip or soak system can work great, or just carefully water the bases of plants by hand.</p>
                                        <p>Most experts recommend substantial, infrequent watering for established plants, typically a total of about one inch of water per week (including rain). One or two applications a week encourages deeper rooting, which promotes stronger plants. To avoid shocking tender greenery, try to use water at or near air temperature; collected rainwater is best.</p>

                                        <p>There are clearly two very different viewpoints when it comes to the health and safety of genetically engineered food — industry leaders and scientists who support GMOs and those who believe GMOs are harmful. </p>
                                        <p>Vocal anti-GMO activists — who refer to GMO crops as "Frankenfoods" — argue that GMOs can cause environmental damage and health problems for consumers.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>Mary Vandewiele, co-owner of The Better Health Store, a chain of 14 health-oriented stores, says that the long-term effect of GMOs remain unknown. “In reading the literature, most of the science and myths are not clear and appear to be intertwined. GMOs have clearly impacted our food industry but to what extent the damage is and can be long term, appears to be uncertain and that is a problem.”</p>
                                        <p>"Genetically modified foods have been linked to toxic and allergic reactions, sick, sterile and dead livestock, and damage to virtually every organ studied in lab animals," according to the Institute for Responsible Technology, a group of anti-GMO activists. They are wrong.</p>
                                        <p>"Most developed nations do not consider GMOs to be safe," according to the Non-GMO Project, which is twisting the truth. "In more than 60 countries around the world, including Australia, Japan and all of the countries in the European Union, there are significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs."</p>
                                        <p>However, many scientific organizations believe the fear-mongering that runs through discussions of GMO foods is more emotional than factual. "Indeed, the science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe," the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) said in a 2012 statement.</p>
                                        <p>"The World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the British Royal Society, and every other respected organization that has examined the evidence has come to the same conclusion: Consuming foods containing ingredients derived from GM [genetically modified] crops is no riskier than consuming the same foods containing ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant improvement techniques," according to the AAAS.</p>
                                        <p>Others point to the benefits of sturdier crops with higher yields. "GM crops can improve yields for farmers, reduce draws on natural resources and fossil fuels and provide nutritional benefits," according to a statement on the website for Monsanto, the world's largest manufacturer of GMOs. Of course, the biggest problem with GMOs is Monsanto itself, but that's an article for another day.</p>

                                        <p>An 80-year-old South Florida man took it upon himself to catch an alligator that slithered into his Southwest Miami-Dade backyard, but after grappling with the unwanted visitor, he needed some help from police and wildlife officials.</p> <p>

                                        Miami-Dade Police and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officials responded to the home along the 12300 block of Southwest 202nd Ave., just after 5 p.m., Tuesday.</p> <P>

                                        Ed Chapman, 80, said he spotted the alligator in his property. He then tried to trap it himself.</P> <p>

                                        “That thing tugged me all over,” he said. “Carried me, twisting and fighting me all the way across the property.”</p> <p>

                                        Chapman said he learned about the six-and-a-half-foot intruder from his dog, Rocco.</p> <p>

                                        “I saw it because my dog ran out, and I saw her veer off, and she ran back,” he said, “and I looked at it, and there it was walking, and I said, ‘Damn, that’s a big gator.'”
                                            </p>  <p>
                                        Chapman said he brought out a noose in an attempt to apprehend the unwanted yard guest.</p> <p>

                                        “I went and got the noose pulled, and I got it around its neck,” he said.</p> <p>

                                        But Chapman said the alligator was not about to go down without a fight.</p> <p>
                                        “He swatted me with his tail and knocked my legs out from under me,” he said.</p><p>


                                        Chapman said he fell on his side, but he wasn’t done wrangling the reptile.</p> <p>

                                        “We argued together until we got all the way over to this pond,” he said, “and then he got his front legs down in the reeds there, and then we went all the way down, and he had his face in the water.”</p>
                                            <p>
                                        It was then that Chapman called 911.</p> <p>

                                        “I said, ‘I just need some help. I got it contained, but I need some help. I can’t get it out by myself,'” he said.</p> <p>

                                        When asked what he meant when he said he “argued” with the alligator, Chapman replied, “Yeah, we argued. Yeah, he wasn’t happy.”</p> <p>

                                        Wildlife officials responded within 30 minutes of Chapman’s phone call.
                                        </p> <p>
                                        Police officers surrounding the alligator and using duct tape to restrain it. They then put it in the back of a marked pickup truck.
                                        </p> <p>
                                        No one was hurt.</p> <p>

                                        Officials said the gator would have been about 8 feet long if not for the fact that part of its tail was cut off, something that, they said, happened in the wild.</p> <p>

                                        Chapman said his gator encounter is nothing strange. The homeowner collects poisonous snakes for venom research and breeds wolves. He said he currently has about 60 snakes in his collection.</p> <p>

                                        Chapman, however, disagreed when he was called a tough guy.</p> <p>

                                        “Nah, not tough. I’ve just been around this stuff a long time,” he said.</p> <p>

                                        Wildlife experts said alligator mating season is approaching, and they want residents to remain alert as sightings will increase.</p>

                                          Why make potting soil?
                                            <br>
                                            Why bake bread?
                                            <br>
                                            There’s really no special magic in good potting soil.  
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>BASIC INGREDIENTS</h3>
                                           <p>  
                                            The three basic ingredients in my mix are garden soil, mineral aggregate and organic matter. Used alone, garden soil is too dense for containers.
                                            </p><p>
                                            The mineral aggregate loosens up the mix to let water flow readily into and through it. Vermiculite and perlite are two lightweight aggregates, the first made from heated mica and the second from heated volcanic rock. Sand and calcined clay (“kitty litter”) are heavier aggregates, so are useful for top-heavy plants such as cacti.
                                             <p>
                                            Organic matter in potting soils acts like a sponge to absorb water, which plants can then draw on between waterings. Organic matter also buffers soils against drastic changes in acidity, and keeps nutrients from washing out through the bottom of seedling flats and flower pots. Peat moss, sphagnum moss and coir (a byproduct of coconut processing) are organic materials that you can buy. Compost and leafmold are two organic materials that you can brew up yourself and, in contrast to the previously mentioned materials, also offer nutrients to plants.
                                            </p> <p>
                                            Some people pasteurize their potting soil to reduce the threat of pests. The key is to avoid too much heat, which can bring its own problems. Bake the potting soil in the oven along with an embedded potato, and when the potato is done, so is the potting soil.
                                            </p> <p>
                                            Rather than pasteurizing the soil, I prefer to avoid pests with careful watering, abundant light, and other cultural conditions that make plants happy and pests sad.
                                             <h3>
                                            SOIL IS GOOD, BUT NOT ESSENTIAL
                                            </h3> <p>
                                            Good garden soil is hard to obtain in reliable and large quantities, so most commercial potting mixes are made without any real soil at all. These mixes are made only from mineral aggregate and organic matter.
                                            </p> <p>
                                            You can make such a soil-less mix yourself by sieving together equal volumes of peat moss and perlite. This mix has no nutrients, so stir in a starter feed of one-half cup of dolomitic limestone and some fertilizer whose nutrient ratio is about 5-10-5. Real soil does add nutrients and other good things to a potting mix, so I favor traditional potting mixes, which contain real garden soil.
                                            </p> <p>
                                            Even if you buy potting soil, keep a few bags of some type of mineral aggregate and organic material on hand. No one potting mix can suit the needs of every plant. Add extra aggregate to any mix used for cacti or succulents, and extra organic matter to any mix for plants such as African violets and begonias that like consistently moist soils.
                                            </p> <h3>
                                            STIR THE BREW
                                            </h3> <p>
                                            For the ritual opening of the garden season, I give my garage floor a clean sweep and then make a pile of 2 gallons each of garden soil, peat moss, perlite and compost. On top of this mound I sprinkle a cup of lime and a half cup each of soybean meal and powdered kelp. This is a mixed bag of ingredients, but I reason that plants, just like humans, benefit from a varied diet.
                                            </p> <p>
                                            I slide my garden shovel underneath the pile and turn it over, working around the edge until the whole mass is thoroughly mixed, and moistening it slightly if it seems dry. Finally, I rub the mix through a half-inch sieve, and recite a few incantations to complete this brew that nourishes my seedlings and houseplants each season.</p>

                                    </div>
                                    <div class="modal-body">
                                        <p>So you want to grow blackberries? Of course you do! Blackberries are nature's best berry. No, banana-lovers, bananas are out of the running. But how do you ensure a successful crop of these delicious berries?</p>
                                        <h3>Step One: Know Your Berries</h3>
                                        <p>Erect blackberries have stiff canes that are upright and arching. They can be trellised or grown in the landscape as a hedge or shrub border. Trailing blackberries have flexible canes that must be tied to a trellis so they don't flop to the ground.</p>
                                        <p>All blackberries grow best in full sun, and almost all varieties are self-fruitful, meaning that you need to plant only one cultivar. As a rule of thumb, five or six plants will produce enough berries for a family of four. Each blossom will produce a sweet, juicy blackberry.</p>
                                        <h3>Step Two: Build Those Berries A Trellis</h3>
                                        <p>Blackberry trellises are simple to build and require only a few dollars' worth of materials. To build a simple trellis, sink two 8' pressure- treated 4x4 posts 3' deep in the ground. If you're working in sandy soil, you can add a quick-setting mortar mix to anchor the posts. In clay soil, simply tamp down the soil to hold the posts in place.</p>
                                        <p>The posts can be set anywhere from 10' to 20' apart. Make two marks on each post, one mark at 2-1/2' off the ground and the other mark at 4-1/2' off the ground. Then, at those marks, attach 9-gauge coated wire to the posts with staples.</p>
                                        <h3>Step Three: Plant That Berry Shrub</h3>
                                        <p>To plant, dig a planting hole wide enough to accommodate the roots without crowding them. Place the blackberry shrub in the hole, positioning it so that the crown of the shrub, where the stem and the roots join, is level with the surrounding soil.</p>
                                        <p>When you've filled the hole about three-quarters of the way with soil, stop and pour about a gallon or two of water into the hole, which will help settle the soil and get rid of any air pockets. Finish backfilling, lightly tamp down the soil with your hands and water well once again.</p>
                                        <p>Different blackberry varieties have different spacing requirements, and you should follow the recommendations on the plant label or the recommendation of your extension service.</p>

                                        <p>I have an extensive garden in my yard, and in years past I have carefully tended it. The petunias were perfect, the tomatoes turned into a (controlled) tomato jungle, and my friends and family were eating the fruits of this garden for months. I was the "garden friend" in my friend group, and I loved it! I say this because...I don't love it any more. I look at the vegetable plots in my backyard and feel no motivation to tend them. My window garden of succulents is turning yellow and leaves are falling off. I let a prayer plant die because I didn't water it.</p>
                                        <p>I look at my once-beautiful, now neglected garden and I just don't care. I don't know why I don't care. I don't even know what to do with myself now since gardening was my one passion. So I ask you, Rosie: how can I fix this? How can I save my garden?</p>

Now I'm going to say something that may seem shocking to longtime readers: let the garden go. You have a different garden to tend for now. Read through your letter with me, letter writer, and count how many shoulds you sense in the words. You have a garden, so you *should* tend it. Your garden was perfect before, so it *should* be perfect now. You were the garden friend last year who provided bounty to your loved ones, so you *should* be that friend this year. I could go on, and I'm sure there's more you didn't mention in your letter. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Lost in the Woods, I want you to help me paint a picture of what your life would look like without this garden in it. What would you do with your time if you didn't have to devote time to watering your plants? What would your yard look like if those plots weren't there? What would it feel like if you didn't have "shoulds" about your garden? You don't have to answer these questions immediately, Lost, but I am going to give you permission to Not Care.</p>
                                        <p>Just like plants have seasons and periods of rest, so too do people. This garden isn't bringing you joy, so let it rest. You don't have to be the garden friend right now; you can let that lie fallow. In its place, what kind of friend could you be? I encourage you to nurture the relationships, hobbies, and connections in your life. Perhaps in several seasons you can return to your garden, yourself replenished. Perhaps this time of your life is over, and something new will grow in its place. Only you can decide that, letter writer, and I can't wait for you to discover what you will become.</p>
                                        <p>Much love, <br>Rosie</p>
